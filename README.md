## Component Structure

The React Multi-Step Form component consists of two main components:

- ActiveState: This component is responsible for rendering the active state indicator for each step in the form. It receives props such as 'formSubmitted', 'activeStep', and 'step' to determine the appearance of each step.

- HorizontalLinearStepper: This is the main component that renders the multi-step form. It manages the form state, handles form navigation, and contains the form input fields. It utilizes the 'ActiveState' component and Material-UI components to create an intuitive form experience.

## Styling

The React Multi-Step Form component uses Material-UI's styling solution to provide flexibility in customizing the component's appearance. The 'makeStyles' hook is used to define CSS styles for different parts of the form.

To customize the styling, you can modify the CSS classes inside the 'makeStyles' function in the 'HorizontalLinearStepper' component. You can change colors, margins, paddings, font styles, and more to match your application's design.
